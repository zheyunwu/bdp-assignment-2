114384,25700871,2015-01-23,1948117,Leo,Decent experience. Host responded very quickly to questions. The bathroom of the unit we stayed in had some sewage smell which was unpleasant; definitely lowered the price-performance of an otherwise good experience.

114384,32251808,2015-05-16,12558117,Dana,"This is a charming apartment with a very comfortable bed, a great shower, and best of all, a very pleasant and helpful host (Helen). The location is just about perfect with the subway nearby as are a number of good restaurants. If you get hungry for some western food, try Annies, only a couple of blocks away. Unfortunately, the building air conditioner was not working and Beijing was having a heat wave. We stayed only a couple of nights out of our planned two week stay. Helen was so understanding as was airbnb. We would definitely stay here again."
114384,34751713,2015-06-11,8594200,Jim,"Helen was there to greet us, extremely helpful and willing to offer tips.  Location is great but the only draw back is there is no parking available and what parking there is; is extremely expensive. Room is clean and nicely arranged, everything is there for you.  A balcony is available but there are no outside furniture available, really wish there were.  The cleaning staff are great and they do a good job keeping the place clean, will stay there again the next time I am in Beijing.

Tks,

It is close to the subway station, coffee shops and restaurants and Walmart is a quick 12 minute walk say. The place is exactly as described and actually looks better than the pictures! The best part is the excellent customer service provided by Helen who was available whenever we needed her or had a question. The apartment also has daily housekeeping which I have never seen at any other Airbnb apartment before. Don't think twice, just book it for your trip to Beijing!"

But, great host, great room, flexible, and kind. Awesome location! Really convenience walking distance to subway stop and heart of the city.

房间大小,装饰等软件,硬件设施都比较到位｡
下次不会入住是不会入住这个区域附近,并不是觉得这里不好｡"

Annies kitchen around the corner is great for italian food if you have overdosed on chinese food :) I highly recommend this place to everyone! Thanks Helen!
114384,161137835,2017-06-17,26086324,Yawen,"This is my first Airbnb experience in Beijing, I'm quite impressed by convenience of the location. Helen is very helpful, she brought outlet adapter to my room late night when I found out my laptop charger doesn't fit the outlet in the room. 
This is a great saving comparing to staying in expensive hotel in CBD area. I definitely recommend for people travel for leisure and business to check out Helen's place. "

114384,185129400,2017-08-21,124857653,Ermei,This unit is one of the 12 units run by the company located on the same floor. It is spacious but the furniture shows wears and tears. There is no condiments in the kitchen. Location is great with a lot of restaurants in the nearby Soho area.  Make sure you use the C #3 subway exit for shortest walk.

114465,3045981,2012-12-08,3607648,Matt,"We had the corner unit which was huge and fantastic. It was clean, and serviced daily. Richard's staff did a great job during our stay, and was just down the hall if we needed anything. The building is a 5 min walk to the subway, and has a good coffee shop down the street. A great massage parlor is also one building away. This place is not in the middle of the tourist activity, but it's not far away, just a few stops on the subway. This place did us well."

128496,295204,2011-06-02,638633,Serena,"A beautiful place, rich history, and Cindy is the one and only.  Lively and warm, but never overbearing.  She knows everything there is to know about Beijing, and is more than helpful in pointing you in the right direction.  She's also one of the funniest people I’ve been lucky enough to cross paths with.  

The rooms are decorated by Cindy, herself.  And it shows.  Each room is cozy and charming, and evokes a sense of home that is rare for me to come across in my travels.  Her courtyard provides an unexpected oasis from bustling Beijing.  From the minute I stepped through her front door, I wished I could extend my trip.  Who can resist sitting on her swing, watching dusk settle over the courtyard; a thousand leaves rustling gently in the breeze, moon peaking crescents over sky.  Or waking up to breakfast on her rooftop deck, gifting a rare view of morning sunlight painting the gently sloping rooftops of one of Beijing's few remaining  hutong neighborhoods.  

In all my travels—from high design boutique hotels, to humble countryside dwellings—Cindy’s home easily sits within my top five.  Simply put, the place has heart. "
128496,298962,2011-06-05,640751,Micheal,I sort of hesitate to write this...when you find a hidden treasure you want to keep it all to yourself !!!. WOW..this was something so special and so unexpected finding this home away from home in such a perfect setting. Was like stepping back in time and leaving the hustle and bustle of Beijing behind. What a perfect place to stay and what a wonderful host Cindy makes !.  As an aussie I was so surprised to find that vegemite was on the menu for breakfast ..have NEVER been to a place that took care of their guests so well. This is an area of Bejing that those poor travellers that chose to stay in impersonal hotels will never get to experience.  Cindy was full on information on what to see and do but to be honest once I was sipping on an ice cold beer on the rooftop balcony enjoying the view and the wonderful company I did not want to be anywhere else. The room was so comfortable and so well decorated and yet stepping outside was like stepping back in time. This is it for me...whenever Im in Beijing THIS is the place for me...keep my room ready Cindy !
128496,415544,2011-08-02,408342,Alex,"I was travelling on my own at the end of a business trip and looking for an interesting, central, safe place to stay in Beijing for a few days. Cindy's place ticked off all those boxes, but my stay there exceeded all of my expectations! 

Cindy and her husband went out of their way to make me feel welcome, suggesting places to go and helping to navigate Chinese menus! Chatting with them about their daily life in Beijing was fascinating - though it was not my first time to China, I felt like I left with a much better understanding of Chinese society,

The hutong itself is beautifully and uniquely decorated, and the courtyard is a quiet haven from bustling, sometimes chaotic, Beijing. The room I stayed in was very spacious and comfortable, with a private bathroom and all the necessary hotel amenities (linen, shampoo, hairdryer etc.) yet felt like you were in the guest room at a friend's place!

I would definitely recommend staying here :)

"
128496,476629,2011-08-26,891870,Amanda,"Courtyard B&B is a lovely, peaceful haven and a perfect escape from the noise and crowds of Beijing. The rooms are spacious, comfortable, and charmingly decorated. The location is ideal: convenient to tourist attractions and metro stations but tucked away in a traditional neighbourhood bustling with locals going about their daily activities. After a day or so, we fancied ourselves temporary Beijingers rather than tourists. 

Cindy and Nico are extraordinarily gracious hosts. When my partner unexpectedly missed his flight, Nico travelled all the way to the airport to find me so that I wouldn't be waiting and worried. Cindy was kind enough to purchase a fantastic cake and gorgeous flowers after my partner told her that he wanted to surprise me for my birthday. I have never before experienced hosts going so far out of their way to help two unknown guests. 

Cindy and Nico are very well travelled and educated and great conversationalists. I learned more about contemporary China from Cindy than from any of my books. She has worked incredibly hard to preserve and renovate her family's hutong and it was a privilege to stay in such a unique home. And the terraces are genius - not something you'll be likely to find anywhere else in Beijing! 

We cannot recommend Courtyard B&B highly enough - it's a very special place with incredibly helpful and generous hosts . We can't wait to be back in Beijing to see Cindy and Nico again, this time with a more relaxed schedule so that we can finally enjoy a bottle of wine together!
"
128496,501117,2011-09-04,1032672,Alexis,"I first heard about Cindy a few weeks ago from a friend and her son who had just returned from a trip to China. When I mentionned that I was looking for a place to stay in Beijing while searching for more permanent accomodation, their enthusiastic praise for Cindy's courtyard made it an obvious choice for me. 

Besides enjoying the amazing location (just a few minutes walk from Dong Si Shitiao station), I quickly came to realize that I could not have found a better place to begin my new adventure in China's capital. 

Cindy and Nikos are kind and caring hosts who consistently go above and beyond their duty of care for their guests. During my stay at their courtyard I was so welcome that I came to feel almost as a part of the family.

The courtyard is beautiful, but the real gem here lies with the people who live there. Besides the pleasure of getting to know Cindy and Nikos, I practiced my Mandarin with Cindy's mom while being introduced to Beijing's Farmer's Market, learnt to cook some traditional dishes with Cindy's cousin and was graciously welcomed by their neighbours. To top it all off, we worked together to host a great BBQ for a group of friends in Beijing I had met on a previous trip in 2008!

I am now a permanent resident in Beijing, and my friends and family know this is the perfect place to stay whenever they come and visit me - thank you Cindy!"
128496,510959,2011-09-07,544594,Lee,"It is quite impossible to review Cindy and her place.  We spent 8 days with them and had one of the best AirBnB experiences yet.  Cindy, her mom and her husband Nikos (yeah he's Greek) exemplify what AirBnB is about.  They provide a friendly, relaxed and affordable home away from home.  She and her husband are available night or day for anything.  At the end of our stay we were sad to say goodbye, but luckily we'll be staying with them again for a few nights in October.  If you're in Beijing and the location is convenient, definitely stay with Cindy."
128496,525329,2011-09-12,127540,Lauren,"Cindy's place is incredible. It's a spacious and beautiful hutong, offering quite a unique place to stay on your trip to Beijing. 

It was easy to get to her flat from the train station and Cindy met us at the top of the metro (line 2) to bring us the rest of the way. Her location is perfect as this particular metro line hits some of the main tourist destinations in the city.

Cindy was so welcoming and friendly. She made us feel right at home. That night she even hosted a traditional Beijing dinner, which we enjoyed with a few other AirBnBers who were staying there the same time as us.  She also provided us with a map to navigate the city, offered some great ideas for things to see and do and made breakfast for us every morning!

There are a few rooms available in the hutong, but never once did we feel imposed upon. The bathrooms and rooms are all separated and spread apart from one another. It's even more spacious than if we were to stay at a hotel and it gave us the opportunity to meet some really great people and share tips on things to do around the city.

I'd highly recommend staying at Cindy's place. We couldn't have asked for a better experience and if I ever make it back to Beijing, Cindy's will be the first place I choose to stay! "

Cindy's guest house made all the difference. She is a warm and witty hostess who offers local insights and suggestions. The location is central and easily accessible with just a short 5 minute walk to the subway.  My guest room was very comfortable with a nice bed, WiFi and good shower / toilet facilities. The courtyard is just a wonderful oasis within a busy, bustling city. I particularly enjoyed exploring the neighborhood, the beautiful courtyard plants, Bell Cat, Cindy's irreverent humor, warm smiles from Cindy's mother, visiting with other guests and early morning tea on the rooftop deck. Hats off to Cindy for this delightful gem. Can't recommend it more highly.
